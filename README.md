# HashMap
Hello!
This is my training project in metaprogramming.

Here is header with template class Hashtable, which has very-very similar behavior with std::unordered_map.

Realized methods:  insert_or_assign(), operator [] acces to the element, remove(), find(), rehash().

This Hashmap doesn't rehash itself.
